--- Props packs: creators' prop libraries (Tom Cartos' asset bundles), unlocked by a Patreon pledge and shown in the Director's Object Library in every game without installing anything. Each pack is a folder at the library root with a folder per bundle; a bundle's objects are loaded on demand with LoadBundle. Placing one copies it into the game. See PROPS_PACKS_PLAN.md.
--- @class propspacks
--- @field simulateLocked boolean Dev mode only: when true, every props pack bundle reads as locked for this account (prelaunch and owned packs included), to test the non-patron view: the locked folder, the Patreon search sub-folder and the Support dialog. Not saved; false after a restart.
--- @field synced boolean Whether the props pack index has been synced this session. It syncs by itself the first time this client is the Director in a game. (Read-only)
--- @field syncing boolean Whether a sync is in progress. (Read-only)
--- @field packs PropsPackInfo[] The synced props packs with their bundles, access and load status, evaluated live (a pledge landing shows on the next read). (Read-only)

--- One synced props pack, or nil.
--- @param pack string module fullid
--- @return PropsPackInfo|nil
function propspacks.GetPack(pack) end

--- Says whether an object folder is a props pack's folder (bundle nil) or one of its bundle folders, or neither (nil). Sub-folders inside a bundle come from the bundle itself and are not reported.
--- @param folderid string an object folder guid
--- @return PropsPackFolder|nil
function propspacks.GetFolder(folderid) end

--- The URL of a small (256 px) preview image of a props pack object, for showing it in a folder or search result without downloading the full image. nil for an object that is not from a props pack, or when the pack's index carries no previews.
--- @param objectid string an object asset guid
--- @return string|nil
function propspacks.GetPreview(objectid) end

--- Loads one bundle's objects into the asset tree (downloaded once, then cached on disk), so its folder fills in. Returns false when the bundle cannot be loaded: not in a game as the Director, unknown, or locked for this account. Watch the bundle's status in packs/GetPack; the objects category refreshes when it lands.
--- @param pack string module fullid
--- @param bundle string bundle key
--- @return boolean
function propspacks.LoadBundle(pack, bundle) end

--- Searches every synced pack's index, loaded bundles or not: each space-separated term must match the start of a word of the object's name or one of its keywords. matchScore sums 2 per whole-word match and 1 per prefix match. Results are in index order (default at most 200).
--- @param options {text: string, pack: nil|string, maxResults: nil|integer}
--- @return PropsPackSearchHit[]
function propspacks.Search(options) end

--- Reads /PropsPackIndex again and downloads any pack index that changed. Calls options.success, or options.error with a message.
--- @param options nil|{success: nil|fun(), error: nil|fun(message: string)}
function propspacks.Sync(options) end
