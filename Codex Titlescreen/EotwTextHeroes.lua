--Encounter of the Week: the words of the heroes -- the hero builder, the hero sheet and the hero cards.
--
--HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE (for writers)
--
--  Each entry is:   text("an.id", [[the words]])
--
--  * Change only the words between [[ and ]]. Never change the id in quotes:
--    it is how the game finds the words.
--  * {name} is filled in by the game (a hero's name, a number, ...). Keep every
--    one, spelled exactly as it is; you may move it anywhere in the sentence.
--  * <b>...</b>, <i>...</i> and <color=...>...</color> are formatting. Keep
--    them, in pairs.
--  * A line break inside [[ ]] is a line break on screen.
--  * Two entries ending .one and .other are the same line for a count of one
--    and for any other count.
--  * Use plain keyboard characters only: straight quotes ' and ", three dots
--    ..., a hyphen or a colon for a dash. Curly quotes, em dashes and other
--    special characters break the file.
--  * Lines starting with -- are notes for you; the game ignores them.
