# Knacks: hero-specific options in montages and journal tests

A **knack** is anything about one hero that changes a test: a language, a
movement mode, an immunity, an ancestry trait, a class or subclass feature, an
ability (Black Ash Teleport), a perk, a complication, a career, a culture, a
kit, a deity, an item they carry, their Wealth or Renown.

Authors write the **intent** ("you can teleport"). The code works out which
heroes qualify, from every rule that grants it: a teleport speed, Black Ash
Teleport, Practical Magic's teleport, and anything added later. Script text
never names pregens.

Code: `DMHub Game Rules/TestRiders.lua` (the grammar, the
vocabulary, `CreatureFacts`). The montage parts are in
`EncounterOfTheWeek/` (`EncounterScript.lua`,
`EncounterMontage.lua`, `EncounterMontageStage.lua`). Tests are in
`tests/encounter_script_test.lua`.

**Only the hero at the entry counts** (montages). A hero approaches an
entry alone -- companions and assists were removed 2026-10-18 -- so knack
versions (`#### If ...`), secret options (`Allow` lines), languages
(garbled speech, `PC speaks X`), edge and bane riders and the other scene
conditions all read the hero making the test.

## 1. The four ways a knack shows up

### Edge / bane riders

A rider line goes in a test's power-roll block, after its tiers:

```
|Climbing Test: Might or Agility (Climb, Endurance)
|You lose a recovery.
|You lose a recovery. The threat is vanquished.
|The threat is vanquished.
|Edge: you can climb or fly
|Bane: you have cold weakness
```

- **Effects:** `Edge`, `Double Edge`, `Bane`, `Double Bane`.
- **Limited to one round:** `|Edge (Round 1): ...`.
- **In the roll dialog:** each rider becomes a pre-ticked chip whose name
  includes the source, e.g. "Edge: you can teleport (Black Ash Teleport)".

### Secret options

An option with an `Allow` line is **secret**: a hero who does not meet the
requirement never sees it. The other spellings of `Allow` are `Secret`,
`Only`, `Requires` and `Required`.

```
### Ask the stones the way

PC lays a hand on a mossy stone and listens to it.

|Stone-Sense Test: Intuition (Navigate, History)
|The stones lead you the long way round => You lose a recovery. The threat is vanquished.
|The old stones remember the dwarven road => The threat is vanquished.
|The stones show you a road no one has walked in a century => The threat is vanquished. +1 hero token.
|Allow: you are a Dwarf
```

- Everyone watches the hero standing at the entry. So a secret option appears
  for the other players at the same moment it appears for the player who is
  choosing, and stays hidden whenever that hero does not qualify.
- A secret option's outcome icons are left off the shared entry card.
- In a **journal** power roll, an `Allow` line still shows the roll locked,
  with "Requires: ...".

### Options with no roll

A `###` option whose `|` lines are clauses, with no `|Name: Characteristic`
header, is taken **without a test**. Its clauses apply at once.

- Lines above the rules are the option's own scene.
- Lines below the rules are its outcome scene.
- A rider line here can only be `Allow`/`Secret`. Edges have no roll to apply
  to, and the validator warns about them.
- For a **knack** (a secret option, or a knack version), no roll is for
  flavour only. A knack that wins something gets its own roll instead (see
  section 4). Options that are not knacks can still have no roll: a
  `Delve: <Name>` door, a free choice everyone sees.

### Knack versions: `#### If <requirement>`

A `####` heading under an option starts an **alternative version** of that
option, for a hero who meets the requirement. Normally it gives the hero
their **own power roll**: a different test, which plays better or riskier
(see "Knack rolls: Better or Spicy" in section 4):

```
### Find another crossing
|Crossing Test: Agility (Swim, Sneak, Navigate)
|... three tiers ...
|Edge: you can swim or fly

#### If you can teleport

PC: Hold this end of the rope.

|Blink Test: Agility (Gymnastics, Alertness)
|You blink short and drop into the ford => You lose two recoveries.
|You blink across and haul the others over on the rope => The threat is vanquished.
|You blink across before the sentries see you => The threat is vanquished. +1 hero token.
```

A knack version can also have no roll: `|` clauses and no test header. Use
that **only for flavour**, as section 4 explains.

- **Heading forms:** `#### If <req>`, `#### Instead, if <req>:` and
  `#### Knack: <req>`. `If PC can fly` reads the same as `If you can fly`.
- **Which version a hero gets:** the first knack they meet. It is fixed when
  they choose the option.
- **What the hero sees:** a violet card with "Knack: you can teleport (Black
  Ash Teleport)", and "no roll" beside the option's name for a no-roll
  version.
- **Scenes:** the option's own pre-roll lines play first, then the knack's.
  The knack's outcome lines play if it has any. A rolled knack with no outcome
  lines of its own reuses the option's.
- **Riders:** a knack's roll does **not** inherit the base roll's edges. The
  option's `Allow` lines still decide who may take the option at all.
- **Montage log:** records "Knack: <why>".

### Scene conditions

Scene conditions accept the same vocabulary:

- `if PC can fly then`
- `if PC has the Monster Whisperer perk then`
- `if PC is immune to fire then`
- `if PC was a Farmer then`
- `if PC carries a lantern then`
- `if PC worships Grole the One-Handed then`

`PC has X` now means anything the hero has by that name: a skill, perk,
ability, trait, item and so on. Use `PC is skilled in X` for skills only.

## 2. The requirement vocabulary

A requirement is a list of alternatives joined by `or`, commas or
semicolons. A bare name inherits the previous kind: `you are skilled in
Magic, Alchemy or Psionics`, `you have the Ritualist perk, Lucky Dog or
Brawny`.

`N or higher` / `N or more` fold into one threshold, and so do `N or lower` /
`N or less`. Because "or" separates alternatives, **no capability phrase may
contain the word "or"**. A test enforces this.

| Kind | Write | Met by |
|---|---|---|
| skill | `you are skilled in Track`, `you have the Track skill` | proficiency |
| language | `you speak Zaliac` | languages known (Mindspeech included) |
| kindred | `you are a Dwarf` / `a Shadow` / `a Black Ash`... | class, subclass, ancestry (with "Elf, High" = "high elf"), and career |
| capability | `you can teleport` (table below) | movement speeds, ability behaviours, immunities, named features |
| anything by name | `you have Black Ash Teleport` | any skill, trait, ability, perk, complication, kit, title, item, career, deity, domain of that name |
| perk | `you have the Lucky Dog perk` | the hero's chosen perks |
| complication | `you have the Frostheart complication` | complications |
| ability | `you can use Black Ash Teleport`, `you have the X ability` | activated abilities, or a trait of that name |
| trait | `you have the Stone Singer trait` / `feature` | any class, ancestry, career, culture, kit or complication feature |
| career | `you were a Farmer`, `your career is Soldier` | the career |
| culture | `you were raised in the Wilderness`, `you come from an Urban culture` | culture name and aspects |
| kit | `your kit is Mountain`, `you use the Panther kit` | kit (both of a Tactician's) |
| deity | `you worship Grole the One-Handed` | the deity choice |
| domain | `you serve the Life domain` | the chosen domains and the domain subclasses |
| title | `you hold the Knight title` | titles |
| item | `you carry a Healing Potion`, `you carry the Bastion Belt` | inventory and equipped items (plural tolerated) |
| immunity | `you are immune to fire`, `you have fire immunity` | any immunity to that damage type |
| weakness | `you have fire weakness`, `you are weak to fire` | any weakness to that type (good for banes) |
| condition immunity | `you cannot be surprised`, `you can't be frightened` | condition immunities. "Surprised" also counts Danger Sense, Primordial Cunning and Unphased |
| size | `you are tiny` / `small` / `large` / `huge`, `your size is 1L or larger` | Draw Steel size order 1T < 1S < 1M < 1L < 2 ... |
| numbers | `your Wealth is 2 or higher`, `your Renown is 2 or higher`, `you are level 2 or higher`, `you have 3 or more victories`, `your Might is 2 or higher`, `your Might is 0 or lower` | Wealth, Renown, Level, Victories, the five characteristics |

### Capabilities

**Adding a capability.** Call `TestRiders.RegisterCapability{ key, phrases,
describe, movement, tag, immunity, sources }`. A plain source name matches
any trait, ability, perk, complication, kit or item. A `kind:name` source
matches only that kind (`kindred:green`, `perk:monster whisperer`,
`language:mindspeech`). Add a source here whenever new content grants an
existing intent. Old scripts then pick it up with no edit.

**Possible next step.** Move the source lists into the compendium, as a
`capabilities` tag list on `CharacterFeature`, so new content declares its own
intents.

## 3. Perks the montage plays by their real rules

These need no authoring. They work in every montage.

| Perk / feature | In a montage |
|---|---|
| Brawny | A failed (tier 1) Might test: the hero is offered "lose 1d6 + level Stamina, raise one tier". |
| Lucky Dog | The same, for a test that lists an intrigue skill. |
| Put Your Back Into It! | Once per montage, the perk's owner is offered "turn an ally's tier 1 into tier 2" when another hero fails (delves included). |
| Pardon My Friend | When the hero fails (tier 1) a Presence test, any other hero with the perk may make the test instead, with a bane: Presence + their own skill, edges and perks, on the test's table. Their roll replaces the hero's. Once per test. |
| Team Leader | In round 1, before anyone acts: spend a hero token, and every hero tests as if they had the leader's exploration skills. |
| Teamwork | No montage effect (it used to let a hero go along twice in round 1; going along was removed 2026-10-18). |
| Ritualist | Once a round, bless your own test at an entry (the ritual needs a touch). A double edge. A button appears for the Ritualist's player while the hero chooses. |
| Born Tracker | An edge on a test that lists Track or Navigate. |
| Polymath / Handy | +1 on a lore / crafting test when the hero has none of the listed skills. |
| Power Player | Might may stand in for the listed characteristic on a Brag, Flirt or Intimidate test. |
| Mighty Leaps (Fury) | A Might test that lists Jump never lands below tier 2. |
| any skill-scoped feature edge | The montage roll now passes the test's skills to the modifier query. So Wode Elf Glamor (Sneak), High Elf Glamor (Persuade), Perseverance (Endurance), Four-Armed Athletics and the like apply exactly as on a sheet-rolled skill test. |

Perk offers time out after 30 seconds.

**Not yet implemented:**
- Wood Wise (needs a reroll inside the dice dialog).
- Area of Expertise and Specialist (they need the perk's chosen skill).
- Charming Liar.

## 4. The authoring standard

- **Every test** carries 1-2 knack riders. Make one *broad* (at least one
  pregen meets it) and one optionally a *deep cut* (an immunity, a
  complication, a rare ancestry trait).
- **Every opportunity** has 1-2 secret options or knack versions, at least
  one reachable by a pregen.
- **About half the threats** have a secret option or knack version, with its
  own **knack roll** (below): the knack's way through, not a free pass.
- **A knack never skips the roll to win something.** Skipping the roll is
  boring, even when the hero earned it. A knack with no roll is for flavour
  only: its clauses give no reward and do not vanquish a threat or clear an
  obstacle. One example is a secret option that only plays a scene: a
  Revenant stops at a grave they remember.
- **Every hero** of the week's pregen party meets 3 or more knacks across the
  montage, and no one requirement carries the montage.
- **Drawbacks as banes** are cheap and make complications feel real (Revenant
  fire weakness, cold weakness). Use about one per montage, and never on a
  required threat.

### Choosing how strong a knack is

| Rung | Use when |
|---|---|
| A line in the scene | It colours the scene, nothing more |
| Edge | The knack helps |
| Double edge | The knack is exactly what the task needs (a Dwarf reading dwarven runes) |
| Secret option / knack version, **Better** roll | Same approach, easier for this hero |
| Secret option / knack version, **Spicy** roll | The knack opens a bolder approach: more risk, more reward |

The top rung used to be "no roll: the knack makes the problem moot". It is
gone: a knack roll replaces it. A knack with no roll only adds flavour, like
the first rung.

### Knack rolls: Better or Spicy

A knack roll is a separate test that matches the knack. It uses its own
characteristic and skills: Psionics for telekinesis, Disguise for a Revenant
walking among the dead, Empathize for talking to the dead. It does not
inherit the base option's edges. Tier 2 should be about as good as the base
option's tier 3, so taking the knack is always worth it. Then pick one shape:

- **Better:** tier 1 hurts less than the base option's tier 1. Tier 3 adds
  something the base option doesn't give (a hero token, an item, an edge on a
  later test).
- **Spicy:** tier 1 hurts as much as the base option's tier 1 or more (an
  extra recovery, malice, the opportunity lost). Tier 3 is clearly the best
  result in the entry: more Intelligence, `Reveal traps during the next
  combat`, a surge, an item.

Mix the two across a montage. Safe knacks reward the hero for being who they
are; spicy ones give the table a moment.

Put a campaign-wide or very strong reward, such as `You know the stamina of
goblins`, on a written critical (a 4th tier line), not on tier 3.

The teleport example in section 1 is Spicy. Here is a Better one, from the
Goblin Ambush tomb. The base option, "Slip past them", is a Stealth test
whose tier 1 costs two recoveries:

```
#### If you are a Revenant
|Masquerade Test: Presence (Disguise, Lie, Read Person)
|One of them hesitates, and you have to fight it => You lose a recovery. The dead fall behind you, spent.
|They take you for one of their own => The dead sink back into their long sleep.
|They kneel to you as to their old captain => The dead sink back into their long sleep. +1 hero token.
```

The Goblin Ambush montage has 13 knack rolls written this way, which are
good to copy.

**Checking it.** The Encounter Script validator (`/eotwvalidate`) has a
**Knack coverage** section. It lists:
- tests with no knack,
- opportunities with no secret option or knack,
- threats with one,
- any requirement over 15% of the montage's hooks,
- a per-hero table for a party you pick. The default is the largest party,
  which in an authoring game is the week's pregens.

The pregens are only a breadth test. Nothing in the code knows them by name.
