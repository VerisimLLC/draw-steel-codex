--Encounter of the Week: the montage stage.
--
--The full-screen presentation every client sees while a montage beat plays:
--the scene as a backdrop, the round's Opportunities down the left and
--Threats down the right, the party's hero cards along the bottom (drag one
--onto an entry to approach it), and the current turn in the middle -- the
--approach text, the options with their power rolls, then the landed tier
--and what it did. After the last round the middle shows each unresolved
--threat in turn with the malice diamond and its consequence.
--
--Shown through GameHud's presented-dialog mechanism (the host presents it;
--every client, late joiners included, instantiates it from the shared
--presentdialog document). All state comes from EncounterMontage's document;
--this file never writes montage state, only requests.
--Design: EncounterOfTheWeek.md, "Encounter scripts: montage beats before combat".
