--This file implements Environmental Keywords: named environmental conditions
--(e.g. "Dark", "Lava") that are known to the game and attach one or more
--CharacterModifiers to any creature affected by them. They are authored in the
--Compendium under Rules and stored in the "environmentalKeywords" object table.
--
--An EnvironmentalKeyword derives from CharacterFeature, so it carries a list of
--modifiers plus the shared modifier editor (CharacterFeature:EditorPanel). This
--is the same relationship CharacterCondition has with CharacterFeature.

--- @class EnvironmentalKeyword:CharacterFeature
--- @field new fun(o?: table): EnvironmentalKeyword
--- @field id string Key of this row in its data table; SetAndUploadTableItem sets it.
--- @field name string Display name of the keyword (e.g. "Dark", "Lava"). Class default "New Environmental Keyword" applies when absent.
--- @field description string Rules text shown to players. Class default "" applies when absent.
--- @field tableName "environmentalKeywords" Name of the data table this keyword is stored in ("environmentalKeywords"). Class-level default; often absent on serialized instances.
--- @field source string Source label ("Environmental Keyword"). Class-level default; often absent on serialized instances.
--- @field iconid string Icon shown in the UI. Class-level default applies when absent.
--- @field display table Icon display settings (bgcolor/hueshift/saturation/brightness).
--- @field difficultTerrain boolean If true, an area marked with this keyword counts as difficult terrain. Uses the same terrain rule flag name as tiles (asset.rules.difficultTerrain).
--- @field terrainKeywords table<string, boolean>|nil Ability keywords (keyword -> true, e.g. {Magic = true}) attached to the difficult terrain of areas marked with this keyword. Folded onto the aura's difficultTerrainKeywords by ApplyToAura; a creature whose Ignore Difficult Terrain modifier names any of them ignores that difficult terrain. No class default: absent = none.
--- @field water boolean If true, an area marked with this keyword counts as water. Uses the same terrain rule flag name as tiles (asset.rules.water).
--- @field concealment boolean If true, an area marked with this keyword grants concealment. Uses the same terrain rule flag name as tiles (asset.rules.concealment).
--- @field coversSky boolean If true, an area marked with this keyword shelters creatures from the sky (a tree canopy, an awning): a creature in it is not "Exposed To Sky" even on a floor with no ceiling. No terrain effect of its own.
--- @field climbable boolean If true, an area marked with this keyword can be climbed, like a climbable wall: creatures in it may climb up to the ceiling of the floor.
--- @field climbersOnly boolean Only meaningful when climbable is true: restricts climbing to natural climbers (climb speed >= walk speed), matching walls' "Climbable (Climbers Only)". Uses the same terrain rule flag name as tiles (rules.climbersOnly).
--- @field stepped boolean "Stepped Terrain": a 1-square change in ground height whose HIGHER tile is in an area marked with this keyword is a sharp step, not a slope. Forced movement bangs into the step going up (a collision) and is carried out over it going down (falling at the end), exactly like a cliff. Walking is unaffected. Solid building blocks are always stepped without it. Engine: Aura.stepped -> TileGameRules.stepped, read by CharacterToken.FindStraightLinePath.
--- @field dynamicLight boolean If true, the Map Markup zone palette offers the "Dynamic Light" option for this keyword (its zones/blanket apply only where the light added by light sources is at or below a per-map threshold; ambient light is ignored). Purely a UI/eligibility gate: the sampling and carving live in MapMarkupPanel.lua; unchecking disables an already-configured threshold without deleting it.
--- @field dispels string[]|nil Ids (environmentalKeywords table keys) of keywords this keyword dispels. Painting a zone of this keyword deletes the overlap from zones of a dispelled keyword (and a dispelled keyword cannot be painted over this one); an aura carrying this keyword suppresses zones of dispelled keywords beneath it for as long as the aura covers them. No class default: assigned per instance by the editor (a class-level default table would be shared-mutable).
--- @field movedamage string Damage type dealt to creatures moving through an area with this keyword, or "none" for no damage. Uses the same field names as Aura so the values copy straight onto zone auras.
--- @field damage number Damage dealt per tile of the area a creature moves through (only meaningful when movedamage is not "none").
--- @field movementDamageFilter string Which movement the damage applies to: "all", "nonshift" (shifting avoids it), "forced" (forced movement only), or "willing" (anything but forced movement or a teleport).
--- @field powerRollEnabled boolean If true, a 2d10 + powerRollBonus power roll is made against any creature entering the area or starting its turn there. Same field names as Aura; copied onto zone auras.
--- @field powerRollBonus number The X in the 2d10 + X power roll.
--- @field powerRollTiers string[]|nil The three power table tier texts (tier 1 = 11 or less, tier 2 = 12-16, tier 3 = 17+). No class default: assigned per instance by the editor.
--- @field powerRollShiftEntryMode "normal"|"bane"|"ignore" How the simple power roll handles entry during a Shift: normal rolls normally, bane adds one non-stacking bane, and ignore suppresses only the simple power roll for that entry. Same field name as Aura; a non-normal keyword mode is copied additively onto zone auras that do not already have a non-normal mode.
--- @field includeAdjacent boolean If true, areas marked with this keyword extend one tile outward (8-way): creatures adjacent to the area count as touching it for enter/start-of-turn triggers (the entry power roll fires for them at the start of their turn, with a bane), but adjacent tiles do not take the keyword's terrain rules, move damage, or modifiers. Same field name as Aura; copied onto zone auras.
--- @field creatureFilter string GoblinScript evaluated against each creature to decide whether the keyword affects it at all. Empty (the class default) affects everyone. Applies to the whole keyword -- modifiers, triggers, the entry power roll, the move damage, AND the terrain rules (difficult terrain, water, concealment, climbable). The terrain half needs the engine: an aura reporting a filter is left out of FloorController.GetTileRulesAtLoc unless the caller names the creature it is asking about, and Aura.ApplyTo consults the filter for everything else, evaluating this script through AuraInstance:CreaturePassesFilterForToken and caching the verdict per creature per game update. Merged onto an aura's own creatureFilter with an "and" rather than skipped like the other fields, because a filter is a restriction -- dropping it would WIDEN who the keyword affects.
--- @field defaultHeight number|nil Default vertical extent, in tiles above the ground, stamped onto new zones painted with this keyword from the Map Markup panel. 0 = ground only (affects creatures standing in the zone but not flyers above it); N = up to N tiles above the ground; absent = unlimited height. Zone bands are ground-relative, so this follows the terrain over ledges and pits. Only a DEFAULT: each painted zone stores its own height and can be re-set in the Edit Zone dialog. No class default: absent = unlimited.
--- @field appearance table|nil Optional visual representation drawn on the map for zones of this keyword (beyond the overlay stripes), edited in the Edit Appearance dialog. mode = "floor": {mode, tileid = tilesheet asset id filling the tiles, edgeWallId = wall asset id drawn as a decorative ring around the boundary (nil = none), alpha = fill opacity, fractalEdge = deterministic organic-boundary strength from 0 to 1 (nil = 0), edgeFade = inward fill fade in tiles from 0 to 0.35 (nil = 0), tileImageId/edgeImageId = source image asset ids shown in the dialog's IconEditors (nil when the asset was copied from an existing tilesheet/wall), tileOwned/edgeOwned = true when the asset was created/forked for this keyword (replaced assets are Delete()d)}. Floor fills force the private tilesheet asset to oneLargeTile so the whole image is the repeating unit. mode = "sprites": {mode, sprites = image asset ids, spriteScale = quad size within the tile, spriteAlpha}. Texture scale/hue/saturation/brightness live on the referenced ASSETS, exactly like real floors and walls. MapMarkupPanel stamps this onto zone aura instances (AuraInstance:GetAppearance); the engine's MarkupZoneVisuals renders it resting on the ground, terrain-conformed and parallax-correct. No class default: absent = no visual.
--- @field appearanceDefaultOff boolean|nil When true, new zones painted with this keyword from the Map Markup panel start with their visual representation hidden (record field hideAppearance; stripes only). Toggled by the "Visuals" pill on the zone palette chip. Only a DEFAULT stamped at paint time: each painted zone owns its own flag afterward (the Visuals badge on its zone-list row), so flipping this never disturbs existing zones. Only meaningful when appearance is set. No class default: absent = visuals shown.
--- @field defaultPlayerVisible boolean|nil When false, new zones painted with this keyword from the Map Markup panel start hidden from players (record field playerVisible). Set by the "New Zones Visible to Players" check in the keyword editor. Only a DEFAULT stamped at paint time: each painted zone owns its own flag afterward (the Edit Zone dialog), so flipping this never disturbs existing zones. No class default: absent = visible.
--- @field script string|nil Optional Lua zone-script source, edited in the Edit Script dialog. When set, one instance of the script runs on EVERY client for each zone of this keyword on the current map (Entire Map blankets included). The source must RETURN a table of handlers, all optional: create(zone), destroy(zone), locsChanged(zone), think(zone), and thinkInterval (seconds between think calls, default 1). destroy is guaranteed to run when the zone is de-instantiated: erased or deleted, its keyword deleted, the map changed, the script edited, or mods reloaded. If locsChanged is absent the script is restarted (destroy then create) whenever the zone's tiles change. The zone object passed to handlers carries zoneid/floorid/floorIndex/mapid, name, keyword (type name), keywordid, color, altitude, height (nil = unlimited), entireMap, locs (list of Loc userdata, ready for e.g. dmhub.CreateWorldDistortion), locsAndAdjacent (locs plus every tile 8-way adjacent to the zone; computed lazily on first read and refreshed when the zone's tiles change) and data (an empty scratch table for script state). No class default: absent = no script.
--- @field entryEffectRule string|nil A rules-engine rule string (the same syntax as a power table tier, e.g. "3 fire damage; burning (save ends)") applied, with no roll, to any creature entering the area or starting its turn there. Same field name as Aura; copied onto zone auras (Aura:GetSimpleEntryEffectTrigger). Never applies to adjacent-only contact. No class default: absent = no entry effect.
--- @field spreadsInto string|nil Id (environmentalKeywords key) of the keyword this keyword spreads into. At the end of each combat round, every zone record of that keyword sharing an edge (4-adjacency; corners do not count) with a zone of this keyword on the same floor becomes this keyword, is revealed to players, and each creature in it takes this keyword's entryEffectRule. Zones are snapshotted first, so the spread advances one zone per round (EnvironmentalKeyword.SpreadZonesAtEndOfRound). No class default: absent = no spread.
--- @field objectKeyword string|nil An object keyword (the Core keywords on a map object, matched ignoring case, e.g. "burning"). When a Targetable object with it is in a zone of this keyword, the zone record becomes objectKeywordBecomes and is revealed to players, e.g. a burning Candelabra thrown into Flammable Oil setting it alight. Checked by the elected host every 0.7s, so it catches however the object got there (EnvironmentalKeyword.ObjectKeywordZoneTick). Only meaningful with objectKeywordBecomes. No class default: absent = none.
--- @field objectKeywordBecomes string|nil Id (environmentalKeywords key) of the keyword a zone of this keyword becomes when an object with objectKeyword is in it. No class default: absent = none.
--- @field mapFeature CharacterFeature|nil Map-wide features: modifiers granted to every creature on a map that has at least one zone of this keyword, anywhere on any floor (e.g. a trap's "Allied Awareness" ability). Each modifier's own filter decides which creatures take it. A player-controlled creature only counts zones that are visible to players, so a concealed trap never tips off the heroes. No class default: absent = none.
--- @field mapid string|nil When set, this keyword is a map-scoped zone type: it was created from that map's Zone Types palette and is hidden from the compendium, other maps' palettes, and keyword dropdowns until promoted ("Make Available to All Maps" clears the field). No class default: absent = a full keyword.
--- @field hidden? boolean Soft-delete flag (unhidden_pairs skips it); set when an unused map-scoped zone type is retired.

--- Folds an Environmental Keyword's mechanical effects into an aura definition.
---
--- This is the single place that knows what "an area marked with this keyword"
--- means mechanically. Both aura-creation paths call it, so a keyword means the
--- same thing however the area was made:
---   * painted map-markup zones (MapMarkup BuildZoneAuraInstance), and
---   * ability auras that name a keyword (ActivatedAbilityAuraBehavior:CastOnArea).
---
--- The merge is ADDITIVE ONLY: a keyword can switch an effect on but never off,
--- and never overwrites a value the aura already specifies. That keeps auras that
--- spell out their own flags behaving exactly as before (e.g. the shadow elf
--- darkness auras, which already set concealment directly), and means attaching a
--- keyword to an existing aura can only ever add to it.
---
--- Deliberately NOT copied: name, iconid, display. Those are the aura's own
--- identity -- an ability aura keeps the ability's icon and colour, and a zone
--- aura takes the keyword's separately in BuildZoneAuraInstance.
---
--- @param auraDef Aura The aura definition to mutate. nil is a no-op.
--- @param keywordid string|nil Id in the environmentalKeywords table. nil, or an id
---        that no longer resolves (deleted keyword), is a no-op.
--- @return Aura|nil auraDef The same definition, for call chaining.

--=== Zone scripts ===========================================================

--load-with-env precedent): create/destroy/locsChanged/think + thinkInterval.
--
--MapMarkupPanel calls EnvironmentalKeyword.SyncZoneScripts at the end of
--every zone-cache rebuild (which runs on every client via the map-aura feed,
--panel open or not). The manager diffs the rebuilt zone list against its
--running instances: zones that appeared instantiate, zones that vanished run
--their exit routine. destroy is HARD-GUARANTEED at de-instantiation through
--three layered mechanisms:
--  1. the sync diff - erasing/deleting the zone, deleting its keyword,
--     breaking or editing the script, hiding the floor, and map changes all
--     land here, because every one of them triggers a cache rebuild;
--  2. a heartbeat (which also drives think) that destroys any instance whose
--     map is no longer the current map, for teardowns whose rebuild the feed
--     never polled;
--  3. mod.unloadHandlers, for Lua reloads.
--Every handler call is pcall-wrapped: a script error is reported (once per
--handler per instance) and never breaks the zone cache or another script.

-- "Elemental" AND the creature has a swim speed. This deliberately covers the
-- Water Wolves (keywords Water Wolf + Elemental, swim 6/8) while excluding
-- elementals with no affinity for water (a fire elemental has no swim speed).
-- Dead or dying creatures do not count as bodies of water.
--
-- The casting creature itself never counts as the qualifying elemental: the
-- Water Weird rule says "any OTHER water elemental", and while a teleport
-- filtered on this symbol is being targeted the caster's own token is still
-- standing on the map, so without an exclusion every square within 2 of the
-- caster would qualify. ActivatedAbility:TargetLocPassesFilterPredicate stamps
-- the caster's token id onto the symbolized Loc as _tmp_casterid; the Loc
-- field honors that here. The creature-side field excludes its own token.
