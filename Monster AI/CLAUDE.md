# Monster AI

This module provides an automated combat AI for monsters in DMHub. When active, it takes turns for all non-player creatures in the initiative queue -- moving tokens, selecting abilities, choosing targets, and advancing initiative automatically.

## File Overview

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MonsterAI.lua` | Core AI engine: turn loop, pathfinding, target selection, ability execution, scoring framework |
| `MonsterAIMonsters.lua` | Registered **moves** -- one per monster ability or combo. This is where specific monster AI behaviors live |
| `MonsterAIPrompts.lua` | Registered **prompts** -- handlers for abilities that require a secondary choice (shift destination, push/pull direction, invoked sub-ability targets) |
| `MonsterAITactics.lua` | Registered **tactics** -- passive scoring modifiers that bias target/position selection (flanking, aid attack, high ground) |
| `MonsterAIPanel.lua` | DM-only dockable panel UI and AI thread: start/stop AI, dispatch registered triggered abilities, view analysis of available moves per monster type, enable/disable individual moves |
| `shadow-elves.lua` | Shadow Elf band AI, including darkness-aware positioning and Eclipse villain actions |
| `MonsterAI<BandName>.lua` | Preferred home for a band's moves, prompts, triggers, villain actions, and monster-filtered tactics |

## CodeMod Registration and Load Order

The Monster AI CodeMod owns its ordered file list. A new top-level Lua file must
be registered with the running DMHub instance; adding it to the filesystem or
manually adding a `require` to `main.lua` does not register it.

Use the DMHub MCP tool after creating the safe baseline and before substantive
editing when possible:

```text
mcp__dmhub__check_connection
mcp__dmhub__register_lua_file { path: "Monster AI/MonsterAI<BandName>.lua" }
```

Use the optional `before` or `after` argument when ordering matters. Confirm the
tool reports both the CodeMod position and successful Firebase persistence. The
registration operation is idempotent and preserves an existing local file. If
the MCP bridge is unavailable, stop and ask the user; do not fall back to a
hand-written `main.lua` require.

The core files must remain ordered before band registrations:
```
MonsterAI.lua        -- must be first (defines the MonsterAI game type)
MonsterAIPanel.lua
MonsterAIMonsters.lua
MonsterAIPrompts.lua
MonsterAITactics.lua
shadow-elves.lua
```

## Architecture

### The Turn Loop

1. `MonsterAIPanel.lua` runs a coroutine (`MonsterAIThread`) that polls the initiative queue.
2. When it is the monsters' side to choose, it picks which waiting initiative group goes next. This runs before every monster turn over every group still waiting, so it is deliberately cheap and plans no moves (see "Initiative choice" in `MonsterAI.lua`). Each member bids `MonsterAI.TurnPriority` times a random factor of 1 to 1.5: minions bid `initiativeMinionPriority` (4), other creatures 1 plus up to `initiativeNearDeathPriority` (3) as they near death. A member that cannot strike anyone this turn (`CanStrikeThisTurn`, a reach check using straight-line distance and, only when needed, its movement area) keeps a tenth of its bid, so every group that can strike goes first. The group's score is its best member's. When only one group is waiting it is chosen without any checks. Run `../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_initiative_choice_test.lua` from the codex root.
   Once a group is chosen and it is a non-player turn, the thread creates a `MonsterAI` instance and calls `PlayTurnSafely(initiativeid)`.
3. Reveal every acting monster that is Hidden (`RevealHiddenActors`, calling `creature:LoseHidden()`), so a hidden monster always comes out and acts; Hidden This Turn keeps its edge. With "Hidden Creatures are Invisible" (`strict:hiddeninvisible`, forced on in EotW) players cannot see a Hidden monster at all, so this is where it reappears.
   Then score all registered start-of-turn Malice abilities, use the highest-scoring affordable option that meets its threshold, and wait for it to resolve.
4. For each token in that initiative entry:
   - If the actual actor is outside the usable map view, pan and sync the camera before it begins. Shared initiative entries can therefore pan again as each distinct monster acts without recentering monsters that are already visible.
   - Minions: find their Signature Ability and execute it as a coordinated squad strike (`ExecuteSquadStrike`). The squad moves as one: every member is planned before any moves, with the squares and charge lanes already claimed by squad-mates held in a reservation table (`ReserveSquadOption` / `SquadOptionIsFree`) so no two members end on one square or charge through each other. The captain (or a member) calls the attack and two or three members shout back (`AnnounceSquadStrike`, which writes bubbles directly through `SpeakNow`), then all members move side by side, each starting `squadMoveStagger` (0.2s) after the last (`RunConcurrently`). Chargers move to their charge start, then all shout "Charge!" and charge together. Each member's plan is checked after movement; a second round re-plans members that advanced, failed, or gained a target slot from a fallen squad-mate. Run `../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_squad_volley_test.lua`. Reassess members who advanced before firing so they can join the same volley, including sharing targets within the normal limit. The rules layer spends the action for every active squad member, including nonparticipants. Reconsider up to 6 action cycles so critical-hit extra actions are used. Each cycle selects a surviving member with an affordable signature; only affordable members join its target pairs, and movement uses the remaining turn budget.
   - Non-minions: iterate up to 6 times calling `FindAndExecuteMove()`, which scores every registered move and executes the best one. A scoring or execution error quarantines that move for the actor; `"failed"` continues to another cycle, while `"none"` or `"unsafe"` stops the actor.
5. After all tokens act, initiative advances automatically. Before each actor, right before each chosen move executes (`TurnTakenBeforeMove`, including a minion squad's moves and strike), and after each move cycle, the turn checks that its entry is still the current one. If something else took the turn (a hero's turn-grab ability, a host clicking the initiative bar), it stops with `TURN PAUSED` and does **not** advance, because `NextInitiative` would end the new entry's turn.

When no registered or synthesized move scores above zero, the actor advances
toward the enemy with the cheapest complete traversable route to an unoccupied
adjacent space with line of sight. It takes the furthest reachable step on that
route using its remaining movement, then reconsiders attacks on the next cycle.
Existing strike planning includes moving into charge position and takes priority
over this fallback. If ordinary movement cannot advance it further, it casts
`Use Move Action` in Advance mode for another speed's worth of movement, provided
the main action is affordable and a route exists. Minions without a reachable
signature target use the same fallback; squad target caps still take priority.

Run `../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_advance_test.lua` and
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_minion_critical_test.lua` from the codex
root to check route selection, action economy, attack priority, and squad retries.

### Zone directives (Avoid, Force Into, Hold)

A zone type (Environmental Keyword) can carry "Monster AI Directives": a list
of entries edited in the keyword editor ("Add Monster AI Directive..."), stored
in `aiDirectiveList` as `{directive, filter}` and read with
`EnvironmentalKeyword:GetAIDirectives()` (which also converts the old
`aiDirectives` on/off flags). Each entry applies only to the AI creatures its
`filter` accepts (GoblinScript on the creature, e.g.
`Name is "Angulotl Daybringer"`; empty = every one). All of them read the
zone's squares from its aura instances (`MonsterAI.InDirectiveZone(directive,
token, loc, subject)`, where `subject` is the creature whose filters are
checked), cached per frame.

- **Avoid**: AI-driven creatures never step into the zone (a wrap of
  `creature:MoveToLocPermitted`, which every non-forced path search consults),
  never plan to end in it, and leave one they stand in ("Leave avoided zone").
  The filter is checked on the mover and, for a mount, its riders.
- **Force Into**: the Push!/Pull!/Slide! prompt prefers landings in the zone,
  and the "Force Into Zones" tactic picks attack positions that make it possible.
  The filter is checked on the monster doing the forcing, not the enemy moved.
- **Hold** (filter checked on the creature that holds): the zone is a post. `CalculateMovementPaths`
  drops every destination off the post while the creature stands on it or can
  reach it, so strikes, bursts, advances and squad moves all plan from the post;
  `ChargeProbe` also skips charge landings off it. A holder that is off its post
  with nothing better to do runs "Return to held zone"
  (`ExecuteReturnToHoldZone`, ahead of the advance fallback): walk onto it if in
  reach, else cast an affordable self relocation onto it (an empty-space
  ability with a Relocate Creature behavior, such as a teleport), else walk
  toward it. Band code that moves a creature outside the path search (jumps,
  shifts) asks `MonsterAI.HoldPermits(token, loc)`; `MonsterAI.Holds`,
  `MonsterAI.InHoldZone` and `MonsterAI.HoldSquares` are the other helpers.
  The Angulotl Daybringer holds the Ritual Basin in Aixco Hollow this way.

### Player reactions during AI movement

Before selecting or playing a turn, the background process also waits for
player combatants' end-of-turn saving throws. Save prompts carry the shared
`end-turn-save` activity ID: the card blocks while unanswered, and its reaction
marker blocks after acceptance until the invocation's cast finishes on the
accepting client. Dismissal completes the marker. This wait has no timer and
does not stop monster trigger polling or cooperative AI shutdown. Run
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_end_turn_save_test.lua` from the codex
root for prompt lifecycle and process wait/resume/stop coverage.

Before the monster side picks its next group, the process also waits while any
live player combatant has a trigger prompt the player has not answered
(`FindPendingPlayerTrigger` in `MonsterAIPanel.lua`): the Gunslinger's Begin
Round "Showdown", Hesitation Is Weakness, any custom class's trigger. It is
data-driven, with no ability-name list. Hostile prompts, power-roll modifiers
and the hidden members of a merged prompt do not count. It also waits up to
10s while a trigger event relayed to that hero's client is still being
evaluated there, because the prompt does not exist until it has been (in the
2026-10-19 playtest Showdown arrived while the AI was already choosing). The
check runs again just before `SelectTurn`. The "Waiting for Fox's Showdown"
banner offers the hero's player Select and Dismiss; dismissing the prompt, or
its 10-minute expiry, releases the wait.

Accepting the prompt does not release it. The card is removed at once, but the
cast runs afterwards and may claim the turn (Hesitation Is Weakness moves
initiative only after its cast completes). So the write that removes an
accepted card also adds a `turn-claim` marker to the hero's
`pendingAIActivityReactions` (in `TriggeredAbility.lua`), completed by the
cast's normal AI-reaction completion path. The AI keeps waiting while that
marker is resolving (up to 60s) and for 2s after it completes, with the banner
"Waiting for Iswyln's Hesitation Is Weakness to finish" (BR8M9Z2W).

The turn handoff itself also waits. A hero's mandatory end-of-turn trigger
whose invoked ability prompts them (Revitalizing Limerick's "choose allies to
spend a Recovery", the Tactician's and Conduit's recovery grants) fires inline
from `EndTurn` and then sits in `ActivatedAbility.coroutineStorage` waiting for
the choice. The `End Turn Casts` between-turn handler in
`Draw Steel Core Rules/MCDMInitiativeBar.lua` (priority 0, ahead of the villain
action window) keeps the ended entry current until this client's casts have
been idle for 0.3s, so the AI host still reads the heroes' side and does not
claim a turn -- no cross-client marker is involved. A cast that never finishes
releases the turn after 600s with an `ENDTURN::` log line. Run
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/end_turn_cast_wait_test.lua` from the
codex root.

`MonsterAI:MoveToken` does not return until the token's path animation finishes
and every player-controlled trigger caused by that movement is resolved. A
movement activity ID follows remote event delivery into each trigger. Remote
movement events use `aiReactionRequests`, keyed by stable event ID, with each
complete envelope stored as a JSON string. The receiving client writes separate
`aiReactionReceipts`: evaluating, evaluated, or failed. It retains receipts and
a local cache to deduplicate retries and repair lost acknowledgments. Unacknowledged
events retry every 3 seconds within the original 15-second delivery deadline.
An evaluating receipt after a reload is ambiguous and must not be executed again.
An expired event must never execute when a disconnected client eventually returns.

After evaluation, `pendingAIActivityReactions` records distinguish awaiting a
player choice, resolving a cast, and completed reactions. Actual player choices
do not use the short delivery timeout. Pending markers keep the host waiting
through Activate/Dismiss and the triggered cast's finish callback. Multiple players
and multiple prompts are handled as one barrier. If a reaction leaves a minion
squad owing deaths, the barrier also remains up while the red-skull choices and
their Monster Death removals resolve. Stopping the AI while it waits aborts the
remaining monster turn without advancing initiative.

A minion offered a trigger shows no skull, and the panel's trigger poll cannot
run during a turn. So while only minion deaths hold the barrier,
`AnswerMinionTriggersDuringWait` answers the AI-run minions' triggers with
`HandleAvailableTrigger` (an angulotl pushed through a Clawfish offers it
Leapfrog; QNT42FK4). A trigger with no AI handler is still covered: the
"choose-minion-deaths" banner in `DrawSteelTokenHud.lua` counts minions whose
skull a trigger hides, so "Choose for me" can resolve them.

Delivery failures, orphaned prompt markers, and evaluation errors stop the AI
without advancing initiative. The panel explains the specific client/ability
being awaited; a failure also opens a message even if the panel is closed. Check
the reaction manually before restarting AI after an ambiguous failure.

The legacy `triggeredEvents` reader processes records individually, retaining
events for other recipients and discarding malformed records rather than letting
a malformed first event block the queue. New AI senders require updated receivers;
deploy/reload the rules and AI changes together on participating clients. An old
receiver will not acknowledge the new mailbox and the host will pause explicitly.

The envelope format prevents a reproduced engine diff race: deep-copying a
LuaPath creates a different userdata object, so an unrelated token modification
emits a leaf patch for the unchanged path. If the recipient has deleted the event,
that late patch recreates only its path, without recipient, timestamp, or event ID.
A JSON string contains no userdata leaves and produces no diff when unchanged.
The engine-wide userdata comparison and other event transports are unchanged.

Run `dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe draw-steel-codex/tests/ai_reaction_delivery_test.lua`
from the parent repository for deterministic loss, retry, duplicate, malformed
message, player choice, cast completion, and failure-pause regression coverage.

### Rolls an AI cast requests of heroes

When an AI cast makes heroes roll (Swamp Stink's Might resistance roll,
saving throws, tests, opposed and contested rolls), the host does not open the
Director's "Requested a ..." summary dialog. Every such cast goes through
`AwaitCastRollRequest` in `Draw Steel UI/DSRequestRollsDialog.lua`, and
`RollRequestIsForAICaster` routes an AI caster to
`AwaitAIRequestedActionCoroutine`. That function accepts the rolls once every
target has rolled, with no timer, and shows the waiting notice (key `rolls`):
"Waiting for resistance rolls to be processed before proceeding (Shadow,
Rook)". Only player heroes are named. Silent abilities the AI casts use the
same wait.

- A declined roll is reset to unprompted, at most every 2 seconds, so the hero's
  own roll prompt comes back. The roll is not optional.
- A target that has left the map is dropped from the request, as the dialog's
  Remove button would, so the cast skips it.
- Stopping the AI mid-wait (or an error in the wait) hands the request to the
  summary dialog, with its current statuses, for a person to finish.

The caster counts as AI-driven when the AI controls it
(`creature.IsTokenAIControlled`, see "Token control" below), or when an AI
activity is in progress (`creature.GetAIActivityInProgress()`, held by
`ExecuteAbility` for the whole cast) and the caster is not player-controlled.
The activity check was added while the control could be wiped mid-cast, and is
kept as a safety net for a cast the AI drives without holding the caster.

### Rolls of the monsters the AI plays

While the AI runs, it makes every roll of a Director-run creature, not just
the rolls of the token it is acting with: a War Dog's Loyalty Collar exploding
on a hero's turn rolls and resolves with no Director click.
`MonsterAI.RollsForCreature(creature)` (`MonsterAIPanel.lua`) is true when the
AI runs on this client, this client hosts, and no player controls the
creature's token. A creature whose token has already left the map (a dead
minion) is matched through the current cast's caster. Both roll dialogs
(`Timeline/EmbeddedRollDialog.lua`, `Draw Steel UI/DSRollDialog.lua`) set
`options.aiRoll` from it in `ShowDialog`. `aiRoll` rolls the dice, hides the
manual controls, waits out hero triggers, and accepts, exactly as for a token
the AI controls.

The same rule covers their invoke prompts. Mandatory triggers fire with no AI
control installed, so a dying Abyssal Hyena's Death Snap free strike on a
hero's turn used to go to the Director. When the invoker has no AI prompt
callback, `ExecuteInvoke` (`DMHub Game Rules/AbilityInvokeAbility.lua`) asks
`MonsterAI.PromptCallbackForCreature(token)`, which returns a handler running
`HandlePrompt` whenever `RollsForCreature` holds. A prompt with no registered
handler still falls through to the Director.

### "AI is running" status for every client

The AI runs only on the hosting machine. So other clients can tell, `MonsterAI.lua`
publishes `{running, busy, userid}` to the `monsterAIStatus` document whenever it
changes (polled every 0.2 s): `running` while the AI process runs, `busy` while it
plays a monster's turn or has an AI activity in progress. Ask
`MonsterAI.IsAIRunningAnywhere()` / `MonsterAI.IsAIBusyAnywhere()` (or
`MonsterAI.BusyHere()` for this client only). A status published by a user who has gone
offline is ignored, and a client clears its own stale status once its AI stops. Turn
Rewind uses it to lock rewinding while the AI plays (`TURN_REWIND_REFERENCE.md`).

### Token control

`MonsterAI:BeginTokenControl` / `EndTokenControl` (wrapped by
`RunWithTokenControl`) mark a token as AI-driven for the length of an action.
The control state lives in `DMHub Game Rules/Creature.lua`, keyed by charid, never
on the token's properties:

- `creature.BeginAIControl` / `EndAIControl` nest a control count and the prompt
  handler that answers the token's invoke prompts.
- `creature.IsTokenAIControlled(charid)`, `creature:IsAIControlled()` and
  `creature.GetTokenAIPromptCallback(charid)` are what readers ask: the invoke
  prompt routing, roll dialog auto-roll, the action bar's target auto-pick, and
  the ability card.
- `creature.Get/SetTokenAIActivity(charid)` hold the activity a token's own
  movement and casts belong to, which `creature:OnMove` stamps on its events.
- `creature.ClearAIControl()` runs when the AI thread starts and stops, so a turn
  abandoned mid-action cannot leave a token looking AI-driven.

Do not move this state back into `_tmp_` fields. The engine nils every `_tmp_`
field on every token whenever it rebuilds the aura index
(`GameController.ClearCreatureTemporaryFields`): a markup zone edit,
`dmhub.RefreshMapAuras()`, or an object finishing loading. That can land in the
middle of an action. Swamp Stink once lost `_tmp_aicontrol` between its Speech
and the cast, after which its prompts and rolls fell back to the Director. A
wipe logs `CLEARSTATE:: CLEARING STATE` and fires the `ClearTemporaryState` event.

### Error containment

AI actions yield while movement, speech, prompts, and casts resolve, so action
boundaries use `RunYieldingFunction` rather than a plain `pcall`. It drives the
action in a child coroutine, forwards delays, and returns errors to the caller.

- A move scoring failure is logged and quarantined for that actor.
- A move execution failure is logged, quarantined, and followed by a bounded
  wait for active casts to settle before another move is considered.
- Each actor has an outer yielding boundary whose cleanup always restores AI
  token control and prompt callbacks.
- `PlayTurnSafely` is the final turn boundary. If an unexpected error escapes,
  it waits briefly for casts, advances only if the same initiative is still
  current, and returns control to the persistent AI process.
- `MonsterAIThread` also contains errors from trigger polling, initiative
  selection, and camera work so an unrelated framework exception cannot kill
  the background process. A failed registered trigger is best-effort dismissed
  after token-control cleanup so the roll that offered it can continue.

Failed move quarantine is per actor and each failure consumes one of the six
cycles. This prevents a broken highest-scoring move from being selected in a
tight loop while still allowing lower-scoring legal moves to run.

### Six Registration Systems

The AI's behavior is defined by six registries on the `MonsterAI` singleton:

#### 1. Moves (`MonsterAI:RegisterMove{}`)

A **move** is a scoreable, executable action the AI can take on its turn. Each move:
- Has an `id` (unique string), `description`, and `category` ("Main Actions", "Basic Strikes", "Maneuvers")
- Lists `abilities` -- an array of ability name strings that must all exist on the token and be affordable
- Optionally lists `monsters` -- an array of `monster_type` strings. If present, the move only applies to those monsters. If omitted, the move is **generic** (applies to all monsters)
- Has a `score(self, ai, token, ability1, ability2, ...)` function that returns `{score = N, loc = destLoc, ...}` or `nil`
- Has an `execute(self, ai, token, scoringInfo, ability1, ability2, ...)` function that performs the move
- Optionally declares `maxScore`, the highest score `score()` can return. Moves with a `maxScore` are scored after the others, and are not scored at all once the best move found already scores at least that much (a tie never replaces the best). The generic fallbacks `Charge and Free Strike` and `Ranged Free Strike` use it: they always score exactly 0.2

#### 2. Malice abilities (`MonsterAI:RegisterMaliceAbility{}`)

A **Malice ability** is evaluated exactly once at the start of a non-player
initiative, after start-of-turn triggers resolve and before any normal or minion
actions. The scheduler finds the registered group ability on an acting monster,
checks `ability:CanAfford()`, scores every matching registration from 0-1, and
executes only the highest-scoring candidate that meets its `minimumScore`. The
default threshold is 0.65, the normal cast pipeline spends Malice, and at most
one registered Malice ability is used per turn.

Completed AI Malice casts are remembered in local memory for the current
initiative queue GUID (cleared on a new encounter or Lua reload). Previously
used abilities receive a 0.20 selection-score penalty. The minimum threshold
still uses the original score, so the AI can repeat a good ability when no
worthwhile alternative exists. Aborted or errored casts do not count as uses.

Registrations can use `monsterGroups` with exact group names or IDs, or the
usual `monsters` list. The scoring and execution callbacks receive
`(self, ai, caster, ability, context)`, with execution also receiving the
scoring info. The context includes all acting tokens, matching group tokens,
allies, enemies, the initiative queue and ID, round, and current Malice. If
`execute` is omitted, the framework casts the ability normally.

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterMaliceAbility{
    id = "Example Group: Battle Blessing",
    monsterGroups = {"Example Group"},
    abilities = {"Battle Blessing"},
    description = "Use Battle Blessing when several acting monsters benefit.",
    minimumScore = 0.65,
    score = function(self, ai, token, ability, context)
        if #context.groupTokens >= 2 then
            return {score = 0.8}
        end
    end,
}
```

#### 3. Prompts (`MonsterAI:RegisterPrompt{}`)

A **prompt** handles abilities that require a secondary targeting choice during resolution (e.g., a Shift destination after a hit, or a Push/Pull direction). Registered with:
- `prompts` -- array of ability name strings this handler responds to. Can be plain names (`"Shift"`) or monster-qualified (`"Decrepit Skeleton:Invoked Ability"`)
- `handler(ai, invokerToken, casterToken, abilityClone, symbols, options)` -- returns a table with `targets` array, or `nil` to fall through to manual prompting
- `abilityOverride` -- optional ability in the returned table. Use this when the prompt chooses a concrete synthesized ability as well as its targets; the invoke framework casts the override and preserves its begin/finish callbacks
- `resolvesInvokedAbility` -- optional registration flag. Set it when the handler carries out the whole invoked ability itself (and returns `{targets = {}}`), so the synthesizer does not reject an ability for prompts inside the invoked ability that never come up

The generic `Adjacent Enemy Free Strike Me` handler uses `resolvesInvokedAbility`.
That standard ability is the "one ally adjacent to the target can make a free
strike against them" rider (Goblin Underboss Swordplay, Human Bandit Chief). The
struck hero casts it, so the ally's nested Melee Free Strike prompt would belong
to the hero and go to the host's action bar. The handler instead picks the best
AI-run ally adjacent to the target (a full monster over a minion) and casts that
ally's melee free strike against the target with `ExecuteAbility`, or skips
when there is none. Swordplay then synthesizes like any other signature.

The generic `Free Strike` handler uses `abilityOverride` to choose the best legal
immediate melee or ranged free strike. It deliberately removes charge movement,
does not take control of player-owned creatures, and also recognizes shared
wrapper names such as `Invoked Ability` when every synthesized choice is a Basic
Attack. Monster-qualified prompt handlers are tried first and can fall through
to this generic handler by returning `nil`.

The generic `Push!`, `Pull!`, and `Slide!` handler recognizes
`vertical_push`, `vertical_pull`, and `vertical_slide`. It uses the ability's
normal altitude calculator and gives altitude priority over its horizontal
collision and positioning heuristics, selecting the highest legal requested
altitude before breaking ties tactically.

#### 4. Tactics (`MonsterAI:RegisterTactic{}`)

A **tactic** is a passive scoring modifier that adjusts the edge count when evaluating strike targets. Tactics don't execute anything -- they bias which target/position the AI prefers.
- `id`, `description`
- `score(self, token, tokenLoc, enemy, ability)` -- returns a number (typically 0 or 1) added to the target's edge score, or `nil`

#### Behavior modules (`MonsterAI:RegisterBehavior{}`)

A **behavior** is a switchable piece of a monster's personality. Unlike a
tactic it is **off** unless switched on: by the monster types in its
`monsters` list (or `allMonsters = true`), or by a behavior source. The two
built in, registered at the bottom of `MonsterAITactics.lua`, are (Bully has
an empty `monsters` list, so it is off by default; Avoid Opportunity Attacks
has `allMonsters = true`, so every monster uses it unless it is turned off):

- **Bully**: `targetEdges` adds up to `MonsterAI.bullyMaxEdges` (6) edges to a
  target as its share of Stamina falls to 0 (dying counts as 0), and cancels
  `TargetStaminaBias`. A behavior with `targetEdges` is also stored in
  `tactics`, so every strike planner, squad and free strike uses it.
  Area planners that score targets without edges do not see it.
- **Avoid Opportunity Attacks**: when the creature starts next to enemies who
  could make an opportunity attack (`ai:OpportunityAttackers`, mirroring the
  checks in `creature:OnMove`), `FindAndExecuteMove` scores every move twice
  (`ChooseAvoidingOpportunityAttacks`): from only the squares that provoke
  nothing, then from every square. The second plan wins only when its
  destination provokes and it still scores higher after paying
  `MonsterAI.opportunityAttackPenalty` (0.8) per attack. A safe choice keeps
  the safe squares for the move's execution (`_tmp_oaSafeOnly`, honored by
  `CalculateMovementPaths`). `CalculateMovementPaths` marks each square's
  `provokes`; the advance fallback skips squares that provoke, and minion
  squads add `squadOpportunityAttackPenalty` (100) per attack to a
  position's cost. It is an estimate from start and end squares: a route that
  walks past an enemy it did not start next to is not seen.

`MonsterAI.HasBehavior(token, id)` answers whether it is on: behavior sources
first (the last one with an answer wins), then the `monsters` list; the panel's
per-type switch can still turn it off. `MonsterAI.RegisterBehaviorSource(id,
fn)` adds a source; Encounter of the Week registers `"eotw"`, which reads the
script's `Monster AI:` lines. `MonsterAI.FindBehavior(name)` matches an id or
alias ignoring case and punctuation. Run
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_behavior_modules_test.lua`.

#### 5. Trigger handlers (`MonsterAI:RegisterTrigger{}`)

A **trigger handler** decides whether the AI accepts or dismisses a specific optional triggered ability. Registrations can match `abilityGuids`, `abilities`, or the displayed trigger name in `triggers`. Adding `monsters` makes an ability-name or trigger-name registration monster-specific. Matching priority is GUID, monster-qualified ability name, generic ability name, monster-qualified trigger name, then generic trigger name. Trigger names are read through `ActiveTrigger:GetText()`, which also supports power-roll triggers.

The handler receives `(ai, token, triggerInfo)` and returns one of:

- `{activate = true}` -- accept using the default mode.
- `{activate = true, mode = N}` -- accept using the one-based ability mode.
- `{dismiss = true}` -- dismiss the trigger.
- `nil` -- leave the trigger for the Director.

It can also return `expectedPrompt = {targets = ..., casterid = ..., sleep = ...}` to pre-seed one nested targeting prompt. Registered prompt handlers remain available while the out-of-turn triggered cast resolves.

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterTrigger{
    id = "Retaliatory Strike",
    monsters = {"Example Monster"},
    abilities = {"Retaliatory Strike"},
    handler = function(ai, token, triggerInfo)
        return {activate = true}
    end,
}
```

#### End Effect (shared, do not re-register per band)

`MonsterAIPrompts.lua` registers one generic `End Effect` trigger handler for
every monster. `MonsterAI.EndEffectDecision` reads the purge behind the trigger
and its Stamina cost from the data, takes it only to end something at least
`endEffectMinimumSeverity` bad (`MonsterAI.conditionSeverity` rates conditions
0-5), and only when the monster keeps the cost again and
`endEffectStaminaReserve` of its Stamina after paying. The choice of effect is
made by `ActivatedAbilityPurgeEffectsBehavior.aiChooser`, a hook the purge
behavior consults before opening its selection dialog for an AI-driven caster:
the worst harm on friends, the best buff on enemies, within the purge's limits.
A band-specific `End Effect` registration would override all of this. Run
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_end_effect_test.lua` from the codex root.

#### 6. Villain actions (`MonsterAI:RegisterVillainAction{}`)

A **villain action** is scored after a turn's `EndTurn` events finish and before
the initiative queue advances. The scheduler enforces the shared one-per-round
budget and the per-encounter used state. Round 1 uses `Villain Action 1`, round 2
uses `Villain Action 2`, and round 3 uses `Villain Action 3`; later rounds do not
automatically use a villain action.

Scores are normalized to 0-1. At a window with `N` legal opportunities remaining
including the current one, the use chance is `1 - (1 - score)^(1/N)`. If no later
legal window remains, the highest-scoring valid action is forced so the round's
budget is not wasted. The normal ability cast pipeline marks a successful action
used and spends the shared budget.

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterVillainAction{
    id = "Example Villain: Dark Arrival",
    monsters = {"Example Villain"},
    abilities = {"Dark Arrival"},
    description = "Use Dark Arrival when it has useful targets.",
    score = function(self, ai, token, ability, context)
        return {score = 0.75}
    end,
    execute = function(self, ai, token, scoringInfo, ability, context)
        ai:ExecuteAbility(token, ability)
    end,
}
```

### Scoring Model

The AI's decision-making is score-based:

1. **Move scoring**: Each move's `score()` is called. The move with the highest `score` value wins. Generic moves like free strikes use low scores (0.2) so monster-specific moves are preferred.
2. **Target scoring within a move**: `FindBestMoveToUseStrike` iterates every reachable tile, evaluates valid targets from that position, and picks the tile that maximizes `numTargets + edges*0.1 - movementCost*0.001`.
3. **Edge adjustments**: For each potential target at each position, active tactics add/subtract from the edge score. Line of sight obstruction subtracts 1 edge. Being a ranged attacker adjacent to enemies subtracts 1 edge.

### Decision Logging

The framework writes structured decision records to `Player.log` through a
single `print()` call per record. Every line begins with `AI::` and names the
event followed by stable `key=value` fields. Turn, actor, action category, move
registration, ability, score, plan, targets, result, and rejection reason are
included whenever they apply.

Normal turn logging includes:

- Initiative and actor start/finish events.
- Every move registered for the monster that is disabled, missing an ability,
  unaffordable, rejected by scoring, or accepted as a legal candidate.
- The selected move's exact category (`Main Action`, `Maneuver`, and so on),
  registration ID, ability names, score, and winning plan.
- Every issued movement and every ability cast, including readable target
  names and cast completion time.
- Malice, villain action, prompt, trigger, minion squad, and synthesized-move
  decisions.

Use `ai:LogDecision(event, fields)` for new framework or band diagnostics so
the current turn/move context is retained. A score callback may return a second
string value when it returns `nil`; the framework records that value as the
specific rejection reason:

```lua
return nil, "requires at least two enemies in the burst"
```

Avoid per-path-tile prints. Summarize the winning target plan instead so the
actual action names and decision sequence remain readable.

### The planning memo

`ai:PlanningMemo()` holds answers that cannot change until the AI yields or
acts: which enemies an ability may target from where the token stands, line of
sight from a square to an enemy, charge probes, and the engine's charge route
cache. The engine resumes the AI at most once a frame and nothing else runs
while it plans, so the memo starts empty each frame; `MoveToken` and
`ExecuteAbility` also clear it, because the AI's own actions change the board
without yielding. Reuse it for any new per-square planning query whose answer
depends only on the board, and key by the objects asked about.

### Profiling

`/aiprofile on` (the `dev:aiprofile` preference; `off`, `report`, `reset` also
work) makes every monster turn print an `AIPERF::` report to `Player.log`. One
report covers the initiative choice that picked the group and the turn itself.
It is built from three measurements, all at the top of `MonsterAI.lua`:

- **Sections** (`ProfBegin`/`ProfEnd`, or `ProfWrapMethod` at the bottom of the
  file): named blocks that never yield. Reported as a call tree and a flat list
  ranked by self time. Do not wrap or section anything that can yield.
- **Slices**: each run of AI code between yields, timed at the outermost
  `RunYieldingFunction` resume. Nothing else runs on the main thread during a
  slice, so the longest slice is the freeze a player sees.
- **Phases** (`ProfPhaseBegin`/`ProfPhaseEnd`): wall-clock spans that may yield
  (the turn, each actor, each cycle, each move's execution), with the AI compute
  spent inside each.

`os.clock` has 1ms resolution on Windows, so single calls read as 0 or 1ms, but
totals over many calls are accurate. Profiling adds roughly 10% to measured
time. The profiler's file-local functions are stubbed as globals in the AI tests
that load sections of `MonsterAI.lua`; add them to any new test that does so.

### Key Helper Methods

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ai:FindBestMoveToUseStrike(token, ability, scorefn?)` | Finds the best reachable tile to use a strike ability from. Returns `loc, score` |
| `ai:FindBestMoveToUseBurst(token, ability, scorefn?)` | Same but for burst/area abilities (targetType "all") |
| `ai:FindBestLinePlan(token, ability, options?)` | Scores line areas aimed at candidate tokens or locations. Supports `candidates`, `scorefn`, `symbols`, `checklos`, and placed-line `locOverride`; returns the best plan with its endpoint, targets, and score |
| `ai:FindValidTargetsOfStrike(token, ability, loc, range?)` | Returns sorted array of `{token, loc, charge, edges}` for valid targets from a position |
| `ai:ExecuteAbility(casterToken, ability, targets?, options?)` | Displays a three-pulse labeled telegraph for placed target areas, preserves the full area target list, invokes the original target type, and waits for resolution |
| `ai:Speech(token, text, options?)` | Makes a token say something (text can be a string or array for random selection) |
| `ai:SpeakNow(token, text, options?)` | Shows the speech bubble at once without casting, so several tokens can talk together. `options.language` (an id or a name such as `"Caelian"`) speaks in that language instead of the creature's own, so players who know it are not shown scrambled text |
| `ai:RunConcurrently(fns, stagger?)` | Runs yielding actions side by side, each starting `stagger` seconds after the last; raises the first error once all finish |
| `ai:FindMostSeniorInitiativeGroupMember(tokens)` | Chooses a live initiative-group leader by non-minion status, squad captain status, then highest EV; exact ties retain token order |
| `ai:FindReachableConcealment()` | Finds the nearest reachable concealed tile |
| `ai:FindClosestEnemy()` | Returns the nearest enemy token |
| `ai:DistanceFromNearestEnemy(token)` | Returns distance to the closest enemy |
| `ai:SetTargetsForExpectedPrompt(options)` | Pre-sets targets for the next prompt callback (used for complex combos) |
| `MonsterAI.Sleep(seconds)` | Coroutine yield for pacing/animation |

### Standard Score/Execute Generators

Two helpers reduce boilerplate for simple strike-based moves:

```lua
-- Returns a score function that uses FindBestMoveToUseStrike
GenerateStandardStrikeScoreFunction(score)

-- Returns an execute function that moves then uses the strike
GenerateStandardStrikeExecuteFunction()
```

## How to Add AI for a New Monster

### Step 1: Identify the Monster's Abilities

Open the monster's YAML file in `compendium/bestiary/`. The key field is `monster_type` (e.g., `"Goblin Warrior"`) -- this is what you match against in the `monsters` array. Look at `innateActivatedAbilities` for the ability names, keywords, ranges, and targeting.

### Step 2: Choose and Register the Band Module

Prefer one `MonsterAI<BandName>.lua` module for a cohesive monster band. Reuse
an existing band module when present. For a new file, create a safe baseline and
register it in the Monster AI CodeMod with `mcp__dmhub__register_lua_file`; do
not edit `main.lua`. Put the band's moves, prompts, triggers, villain actions,
and monster-filtered tactics together in that module.

### Step 3: Register Moves in the Band Module

For each ability or combo the monster should use, add a `MonsterAI:RegisterMove{}` call. Example for a simple strike:

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterMove{
    id = "Razor Claws",           -- unique ID, typically matches ability name
    category = "Main Actions",     -- or "Maneuvers", "Basic Strikes"
    monsters = {"Ghoul"},          -- monster_type strings from the YAML
    abilities = {"Razor Claws"},   -- ability name(s) that must be present and affordable
    description = "Ghoul's preferred melee attack.",
    score = GenerateStandardStrikeScoreFunction(1),
    execute = GenerateStandardStrikeExecuteFunction(),
}
```

### Step 4: Choose a Score Value

Score values determine priority. Guidelines:
- **0.2** -- Generic fallback (free strikes). Monster-specific moves should always score higher
- **0.5 - 0.8** -- Situational moves (hide, maneuvers with conditions)
- **1.0** -- Standard signature ability
- **1.5 - 2.5** -- Powerful or malice-costing abilities that should be preferred when available
- Return `nil` from `score()` if the move can't be used (no targets in range, conditions not met)

### Step 5: Write the Score Function

The score function evaluates whether the move is viable and how good it is. Common patterns:

**Simple strike** -- use the standard generator:
```lua
score = GenerateStandardStrikeScoreFunction(1),
```

**Strike with custom target preference** -- provide a scoring function:
```lua
score = function(self, ai, token, ability)
    local loc, score = ai:FindBestMoveToUseStrike(token, ability, function(targetToken, edges)
        -- the house default: a slight lean toward the enemy with the most Stamina
        return 1 + (edges or 0)*0.1 + MonsterAI.TargetStaminaBias(targetToken)
    end)
    if loc ~= nil then
        return {score = score, loc = loc}
    end
end,
```

Target scorers lean slightly toward healthy enemies, not wounded ones, so
monsters do not focus down the hero closest to dying (that is not fun to play
against). Use `MonsterAI.TargetStaminaBias` rather than writing your own
Stamina term, unless the monster's printed tactics call for picking on the
wounded. If you do need a hero's Stamina fraction, divide by
`properties:MaxHitpoints()`: the `max_hitpoints` field on a hero is a stale
default of 10, not the real maximum.

**Burst/area ability** -- use `FindBestMoveToUseBurst`:
```lua
score = function(self, ai, token, ability)
    local loc, score = ai:FindBestMoveToUseBurst(token, ability, function(targetToken)
        if targetToken:IsFriend(token) then return -1 end  -- avoid allies
        return 1
    end)
    if loc ~= nil and score >= 2 then  -- only use if hitting 2+ enemies
        return {score = score * 0.5, loc = loc}
    end
end,
```

**Conditional availability** -- return `nil` when conditions aren't met:
```lua
score = function(self, ai, token, ability)
    if token.properties:HasNamedCondition("Hidden") then
        return nil  -- don't use this if already hidden
    end
    -- ...
end,
```

### Step 6: Write the Execute Function

The execute function performs the move. Standard pattern:

```lua
execute = function(self, ai, token, scoringInfo, ability)
    -- 1. Move to the chosen position
    local path = token:Move(scoringInfo.loc, {maxCost = 10000, ignoreFalling = false})
    ai.Sleep(0.5)

    -- 2. Optional: say something for flavor
    ai:Speech(token, {"Attack!", "Take this!"})
    ai.Sleep(0.5)

    -- 3. Find targets and execute the ability
    local targets = ai:FindValidTargetsOfStrike(token, ability, scoringInfo.loc)
    ai:ExecuteAbility(token, ability, targets)
end,
```

For burst abilities, omit the targets parameter:
```lua
ai:ExecuteAbility(token, ability)  -- auto-targets all in range
```

For placed cube, line, cone, and map areas, pass the original ability plus the
chosen shape and every filtered creature inside it:
```lua
ai:ExecuteAbility(token, ability, targets, {
    symbols = {targetArea = area},
    targetArea = area,
})
```

Do not rewrite an area ability to `target` or replace its `numTargets`. The
execution helper preserves the supplied area target list and passes the shape
through the normal `Cast()` contract.

### Step 7: Handle Prompts (If Needed)

If the monster's ability triggers a secondary prompt (e.g., forced movement direction, a sub-ability invocation), add a prompt handler in `MonsterAIPrompts.lua`:

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterPrompt{
    prompts = {"Monster Name:Ability Name"},  -- or just "Ability Name" if generic
    handler = function(ai, invokerToken, casterToken, abilityClone, symbols, options)
        -- Calculate best target/location for the prompt
        -- Return {targets = {{token = someToken}}} or {targets = {{loc = someLoc}}}
        -- Add abilityOverride = concreteAbility when resolving a synthesized chooser
        -- Return nil to fall back to manual prompting
    end,
}
```

### Step 8: Register Tactics (If Needed)

If the monster benefits from a positioning tactic not already registered, add it in `MonsterAITactics.lua`:

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterTactic{
    id = "My Tactic",
    description = "Description of what the tactic does.",
    score = function(self, token, tokenLoc, enemy, ability)
        -- Return a number (typically 1) to add an edge for this target
        -- Return nil or 0 for no bonus
    end,
}
```

Note: tactics apply to ALL monsters unless filtered with a `monsters` array.

### Multi-Ability Combos

For monsters that should combo abilities (e.g., Leap then Razor Claws), list multiple abilities:

```lua
MonsterAI:RegisterMove{
    id = "Leap and Claw",
    monsters = {"Ghoul"},
    abilities = {"Leap", "Razor Claws"},  -- both must be present and affordable
    score = function(self, ai, token, leapAbility, razorClawsAbility)
        -- score function receives abilities in order
    end,
    execute = function(self, ai, token, scoringInfo, leapAbility, razorClawsAbility)
        -- execute both in sequence
        ai:ExecuteAbility(token, leapAbility, leapTargets)
        ai.Sleep(0.5)
        ai:ExecuteAbility(token, razorClawsAbility, clawTargets)
    end,
}
```

Use `ai:SetTargetsForExpectedPrompt{}` if the first ability triggers a prompt that should be auto-resolved for the combo.

## Bestiary support assessment

`MonsterAISupport.lua` works out, from a bestiary entry with no token or
combat, how much of a monster's kit the AI will use:
`MonsterAI.AssessSupport(props)` (or `MonsterAI.AssessBestiarySupport(monsterid)`,
remembered for 60 s; `MonsterAI.InvalidateSupport` forgets). It reads the
loaded registries rather than the `.lua` text, so it reports exactly what the
AI runs:

- Each of the monster's own abilities (innate plus trait-granted), villain
  actions, band and own Malice, and triggered actions gets a status: tailored
  (registered for this monster or its band), generic (a shared move), squad
  (minion signature), synthesized (`GetSynthesizedAbilityProfile`, which takes
  `{ignoreImplementation = true}` so "blocked only by automation" can be
  reported), automatic (mandatory trigger), narrative, or unused with a plain
  reason.
- Every `Register*` call stamps `registeredAt` ("MonsterAIGoblins.lua:352"), so
  the report points at the hand-written AI.
- Registrations naming abilities or triggers the monster lacks are listed as
  stale.
- The level is Minimal (signature unusable), Basic, Capable (60% weighted
  coverage, villain actions handled; generic-only AI tops out here) or
  Tailored (hand-written, 90%, no unhandled optional triggers).

**Keep it in step with the registries:** a new kind of registration the AI
runs must be counted in `AssessSupport`, or monsters that rely on it will read
as unsupported. The Encounter of the Week bestiary assessment
(`EncounterOfTheWeek/EncounterMonsterAssessment.lua`) is the consumer. Run
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_support_assessment_test.lua` from the
codex root.

## Existing Monster AIs

Currently implemented in `MonsterAIMonsters.lua`:

| Monster Type | Moves |
|---|---|
| *(Generic - all monsters)* | Charge and Free Strike, Ranged Free Strike, Knockback, Grab, Aid Attack |
| Goblin Warrior | Spear Charge, Bury the Point |
| Goblin Assassin / Goblin Pirate Assassin | Sword Stab, Shadow Chains, Hide in Concealment |
| Bugbear Channeler | Shadow Drag, Twist Shape, Blistering Element |
| Ryll | Two Shot |
| Ghoul | Razor Claws, Leap and Claw |
| Zombie | Clobber and Clutch, Zombie Dust |
| Skeleton | Bone Shards, Bone Spur |
| War Spider | Trigger: Skitter |

## Tips

- The `monster_type` field in the YAML must match the `monsters` array exactly (it is case-sensitive).
- Generic moves (no `monsters` array) are available to all monsters as fallbacks. Keep their scores low.
- `ai.Sleep()` calls add pacing between actions so the DM can follow what is happening. Use 0.3-1.0 seconds between steps.
- `ai:Speech()` accepts a string or an array of strings (picks one at random). Good for flavor.
- The AI iterates up to 6 action cycles per token, so a monster can use a maneuver + a main action + more if it has the resources.
- Abilities must be affordable (`ability:CanAfford(token)`) or the move is skipped. The framework checks this automatically before calling `score()`.
- The scoring info table returned from `score()` is passed directly to `execute()` as `scoringInfo`. You can store arbitrary data in it (e.g., a pre-computed target list).
- Minions are handled automatically via `ExecuteSquadStrike` -- you generally don't need to register moves for them.
- The DM can enable/disable individual moves per monster type via the Monster AI panel.

### Charge routes and failed movement

Ground charges are planned on candidate landing squares within melee range, not
on the occupied target square. `ChargeProbe` asks the engine for every working
no-jump route to those squares in one call (`CharacterToken:FindChargeRoutes`,
cheapest first, exactly what `PlanCharge` would find square by square) and then
applies the AI's own checks: height-aware reach and routes that already failed
this turn. Generic straight-line previews interpret the
input altitude as an offset above ground and must not receive a target token's
absolute altitude for charge planning. Execution revalidates the landing and uses
its charge segment's zero-altitude `loc` with straight-line walking; the absolute
`expectedLoc`/destination is used to verify arrival. Jump-assisted charge plans
are not currently selected by the AI. Synthetic leap combos retain their separate
probe and ability execution.

A charge moves the creature once, so every target of a multi-target Charge
strike must be hit from one landing. `FindValidTargetsOfStrike` still plans a
landing per target; `ai:SelectChargeTargets(token, ability, candidates,
numTargets?, scoreOf?)` turns that into one plan (no charge, or one shared
landing that every chosen target carries as `charge`). The strike planners,
the synthesized moves and the plan preview call it, and `ExecuteAbility` calls
it again on any target list a band passes in, then charges at most once and
strikes whichever targets are still legal from where the creature ended up.
`MoveToken` to the square the creature already stands on logs
`MOVEMENT SKIPPED` and returns `nil, true` without asking the engine to move.

Failed charge routes are excluded for that actor's turn, including when another
strike registration considers the same route. Failed movement records a transient
failure even when a band callback discards `ExecuteAbility`'s return value; the
move loop quarantines the failed registration and considers alternatives. A
failed minion charge cancels that member's target assignment without cancelling
other members' strikes.

Run `../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_charge_test.lua` and
`../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_advance_test.lua` from the codex root for
charge altitude, route failure, and fallback regression coverage.

### Altitude-aware targeting

Use `MonsterAI.TargetDistance(actor, target)` for creature range and adjacency
checks. It combines the engine's horizontal footprint distance with the gap
between occupied vertical squares, in native units. Absolute token altitude
includes floor elevation and mounted riders; `tileSize` supplies creature height.
Use `ai:TargetDistanceFromLoc(actor, target, loc)` for a proposed movement location.
Ordinary strikes, charge landings, squad assignments, bursts, and direct casts
check altitude; direct casts and secondary token prompts revalidate actual range.
Map-wide abilities and placed-area membership keep their existing targeting rules.

Run `../dependencies/lua/bin/lua.exe tests/ai_altitude_test.lua` for range boundaries,
creature size, theoretical movement, and direct-cast validation. The charge and
minion tests also cover targets that are vertically out of reach.
